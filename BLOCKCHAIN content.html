        <h1>BLOCKCHAIN</h1>
        <p>
                A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). 
            </p>
            
            <p>By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain. 
            </p>
        <p>Blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications, and blockchains that are readable by the public are widely used by cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is considered a type of payment rail. Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil".

       <h2> How Does Blockchain Technology Work? </h2>
       
      
        <p>In recent years, you may have noticed many businesses around the world integrating Blockchain technology. But how exactly does Blockchain technology work? Is this a significant change or a simple addition? The advancements of Blockchain are still young and have the potential to be revolutionary in the future; so, let’s begin demystifying this technology.

      </p>

     <br>
      <h1>Blockchain is a combination of three leading technologies:</h1>
     <br>
     <ul>
     <li>Cryptographic keys</li>
     <li>A peer-to-peer network containing a shared ledger</li>
     <li>A means of computing, to store the transactions and records of the network</li>
     </ul>
    <br>
      <p>Cryptography keys consist of two keys – Private key and Public key. These keys help in performing successful transactions between two parties. Each individual has these two keys, which they use to produce a secure digital identity reference. This secured identity is the most important aspect of Blockchain technology. In the world of cryptocurrency, this identity is referred to as ‘digital signature’ and is used for authorizing and controlling transactions.
      </p>
      <p>The digital signature is merged with the peer-to-peer network; a large number of individuals who act as authorities use the digital signature in order to reach a consensus on transactions, among other issues. When they authorize a deal, it is certified by a mathematical verification, which results in a successful secured transaction between the two network-connected parties. So to sum it up, Blockchain users employ cryptography keys to perform different types of digital interactions over the peer-to-peer network.
      </p>

<h1><u>Types of Blockchains:-</u></h1>

<ul>
  <li>Public blockchain: A public, or permission-less, blockchain network is one where anyone can participate without restrictions. Most types of cryptocurrencies run on a public blockchain that is governed by rules or consensus algorithms.</li>
  <li>Permissioned blockchain: A private, or permissioned, blockchain allows organizations to set controls on who can access blockchain data. Only users who are granted permissions can access specific sets of data. Oracle Blockchain Platform is a permissioned blockchain.</li>
</ul>

<h1><u>The Business Value of Blockchain:-</u></h1>
<p>The use of blockchain technology is expected to significantly increase over the next few years. This game-changing technology is considered both innovative and disruptive because blockchain will change existing business processes with streamlined efficiency, reliability, and security.
</p>
<br>
<p>Blockchain technology delivers specific business benefits that help companies in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishes trust among parties doing business together by offering reliable, shared data</li>
<li>Eliminates siloed data by integrating data into one system through a distributed ledger shared within a network that permissioned parties can access</li>
<li>Offers a high level of security for data</li>
<li>Reduces the need for third-party intermediaries</li>
<li>Creates real-time, tamper-evident records that can be shared among all participants</li>
<li>Allows participants to ensure the authenticity and integrity of products placed into the stream of commerce</li>
<li>Enables seamless tracking and tracing of goods and services across the supply chain</li>
</ul>
<h2>An Emerging Technology</h2>
<p>Blockchain is an emerging technology that can work with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning to help users achieve important insights from data.</p>
<p>Traditional IT systems are not built to handle the massive amount of data from an IoT deployment. The volume, velocity, and variety of data produced by IoT networks could overwhelm enterprise systems or severely limit the ability to trigger timely decisions against trusted data. Blockchain’s distributed ledger technology has the potential to address these scalability challenges with improved security and transparency.</p>

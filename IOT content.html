        <h1>IOT (INTERNET OF THINGS)</h1>
        <p>
                The Internet of things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. 
            </p>
            
            <p>The definition of the Internet of things has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. Traditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation including home and building automation), and others all contribute to enabling the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers.There are a number of serious concerns about dangers in the growth of IoT, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun including the development of international standards.

       <h2> Why Is IoT so Important? </h2>
       
      
        <p>Over the past few years, IoT has become one of the most important technologies of the 21st century. Now that we can connect everyday objects—kitchen appliances, cars, thermostats, baby monitors—to the internet via embedded devices, seamless communication is possible between people, processes, and things.
By means of low-cost computing, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile technologies, physical things can share and collect data with minimal human intervention. In this hyperconnected world, digital systems can record, monitor, and adjust each interaction between connected things. The physical world meets the digital world—and they cooperate.

      <h1>What Technologies Have Made IoT Possible?</h1>
     <br>
     <p>
     While the idea of IoT has been in existence for a long time, a collection of recent advances in a number of different technologies has made it practical.
     </p> 
     <ul>
     <li>Access to low-cost, low-power sensor technology. Affordable and reliable sensors are making IoT technology possible for more manufacturers. </li>
     <li>Connectivity. A host of network protocols for the internet has made it easy to connect sensors to the cloud and to other “things” for efficient data transfer. </li>
     <li>Cloud computing platforms. The increase in the availability of cloud platforms enables both businesses and consumers to access the infrastructure they need to scale up without actually having to manage it all. </li>
     <li>Machine learning and analytics. With advances in machine learning and analytics, along with access to varied and vast amounts of data stored in the cloud, businesses can gather insights faster and more easily. The emergence of these allied technologies continues to push the boundaries of IoT and the data produced by IoT also feeds these technologies. </li>
     <li>Conversational artificial intelligence (AI). Advances in neural networks have brought natural-language processing (NLP) to IoT devices (such as digital personal assistants Alexa, Cortana, and Siri) and made them appealing, affordable, and viable for home use.</li>

<h1><u>IOT(INTERNET OF THINGS) EXAMPLES IN DETAIL:-</u></h1>

<ul>
  <li>
<p><h2>1)Sensors/Devices</h2></p>
First, sensors or devices collect data from their environment. This could be as simple as a temperature reading or as complex as a full video feed.



<br>
I use “sensors/devices,” because multiple sensors can be bundled together or sensors can be part of a device that does more than just sense things. For example, your phone is a device that has multiple sensors (camera, accelerometer, GPS, etc), but your phone is not just a sensor.However, whether it’s a standalone sensor or a full device, in this first step data is being collected from the environment by something.

<br>
<li> <h2>2)Connectivity</h2> </li>
<p></p>
<u>Next, that data is sent to the cloud (what’s the cloud?), but it needs a way to get there!</u>
<br>
<p>The sensors/devices can be connected to the cloud through a variety of methods including: cellular, satellite, WiFi, Bluetooth, low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN), or connecting directly to the internet via ethernet.</p>
<br>

<p>Each option has tradeoffs between power consumption, range and bandwidth (here’s a simple explanation). Choosing which connectivity option is best comes down to the specific IoT application, but they all accomplish the same task: getting data to the cloud.</p>
<br>

<br>
<li><h2>3)Data Processing </h2> </li>
<br>
<p> Once the data gets to the cloud, software performs some kind of processing on it.</p>
<br>
<p> This could be very simple, such as checking that the temperature reading is within an acceptable range. Or it could also be very complex, such as using computer vision on video to identify objects (such as intruders in your house). </p>
<br>
<p> But what happens when the temperature is too high or if there is an intruder in your house? That’s where the user comes in.</p>
<br>

<br>
<li><h2>4)User Interface </h2></li>
<p>Next, the information is made useful to the end-user in some way. This could be via an alert to the user (email, text, notification, etc). For example, a text alert when the temperature is too high in the company’s cold storage. </p>
<br>
<p>Also, a user might have an interface that allows them to proactively check in on the system. For example, a user might want to check the video feeds in their house via a phone app or a web browser. </p>
<br>
<p>However, it’s not always a one-way street. Depending on the IoT application, the user may also be able to perform an action and affect the system. For example, the user might remotely adjust the temperature in the cold storage via an app on their phone. </p>
<br>
<p>And some actions are performed automatically. Rather than waiting for you to adjust the temperature, the system could do it automatically via predefined rules. And rather than just call you to alert you of an intruder, the IoT system could also automatically notify relevant authorities. </p>

        <h1>NETWORK TECHNOLOGY </h1>
        <p>
                The technology which is used to exchange the data between small and large information is called network technology. This technology can be used in educational institutions as well as businesses.  
            </p>
            
            <p>Network technicians know the installation, configuration & troubleshooting of the network technology and this can be used to send digital data like audio, data and visual files. By using networking, users can send messages, files through e-mail or other channels based on the organizations requirement.

      <h1>Types of Network Technology : </h1>

     <br>
     <p>
     The classification of Network Technology can be done based on transmission and scale. By using this technology,data transmission,as well as exchange,can be done.
     </p> 
     <ul>
     <li> <h3> Network Technologies based on Transmission : </h3></li>
     
     <p> The network technology based on transmission can be done using the two concepts like point-to-point and multipoint.</p>
     <ul>
     <li>Point to Point : In point to point, when sender & receiver (nodes) are connected directly, then the data transmission can be done with the help of a guided medium, used for the wired network and unguided medium, used for the wireless network. The following image shows the point to point network technology.
     </li>
     <li>Multi-point : In multi-point, several nodes are connected directly with the help of a common medium in a linear manner. The following image shows the multi-point network technology
This kind of transmission mainly works on any of these two connections like time-sharing otherwise spatially shared. In the first connection, every node is accessible with a separate time of slot to converse, whereas, in the second connection, the communication between the nodes can be done simultaneously at a time.
     </li>
     </ul>
     <li> <h3> Network Technologies based on Scale : </h3></li>
<br>
    <p>The network technology based on the scale can be done using concepts like LAN, MAN, WAN, PAN, and VPN.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><h4>LAN (Local Area Network) : </h4></li>
    <p>An alternate name of LAN is IEEE 802 network and this network uses devices like computers, laptops, and mobiles that are connected in a small range which ranges from 100m to 10km. The properties of this network mainly depend on its users, speed, range, as well as error rate.</p>

<h5>The main elements of LAN mainly include the following.</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Peripheral devices like printers, scanners, etc.</li>
    <li>A HUB or the middle of a network can be accountable for attracting the signals. It is smart enough for transmitting the data packets from the sender to the receiver.</li>
    <li>Cables like twisted pair, optical fiber, and coaxial cables are used as backbone cables due to their high bandwidth capacity.</li>
    <li>Nodes/PC/computer/Host/server/workstation</li>
    <li>Network interface card- NIC</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <li><h4>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)</h4></li>
    <p>A network where numerous LANs are united jointly through a networking device is known as Bridge, and it forms a MAN (metropolitan area network). The following image shows the MAN technology in computer networks.</p>

<br>   
<li><h4>WAN (Wide Area Network)</h4></li>
    <p>A network where numerous WANs are united jointly through a networking device is known as route, and it forms a WAN (wide area network). The following image shows the WAN technology in computer networks.</p>
    <br>
<img src="https://beginnersbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Wide_area_network_WAN.png " alt=" wan image" width="600" height="400">    
<p><h5>There are two types of WANs namely public WAN and private WAN.</h5></p>  
    <ul>
    <li>Public WAN : This kind of WAN is handled through government divisions.</li>
    <li>Private WAN:  This kind of WAN is expanded by the departments of the US Military, Defence wing known as ARPANET.</li>
    </ul> 
    <br>
    <p><h5>WAN Elements</h5></p>
    <ul>
    <li>The elements of WAN are bridge, router, and gateway.</li>
    <li>The bridge is a device, used to connect related otherwise different LANs.</li>
    <li>The router is a device, sued to connect related otherwise different networks.</li>
    <li>Gateway is one kind of device, used to connect networks by using various types of architectures. For instance, by using this gateway, communication between a mobile device containing 4G connection & landline device containing 2G connection</li>
    </ul>
   <br>
    <li><h4>PAN (Personal Area Network) : </h4></li>
    <p>A PAN (personal area network) is a computer network, and it allows communication between computer devices close to a person. These networks can be wired like USB otherwise FireWire and also they are wireless like IR, ultra-wideband, and ZigBee. The range of this network is normally is some meters. The best examples of this mainly include wireless keyboards, cell phone headsets, printers, bar code scanners, wireless mice & game consoles. This network is mainly used for personal purposes.  </p>

<br>    
<li><h4>VPN (Virtual Private Network) : </h4></li>
    <p> A VPN (a virtual private network) is started virtually on the public network for communicating as well as transmitting data from sender to receiver. This network creates a secure, encrypted link above a less-secure network like the public internet. This network uses tunneling protocols for encrypting & decrypting data at the ends of the sender and receiver. </p>
